# Introduction 

High school is one of the most transformative periods in a young adult's life. 
During it, students must learn to balance school work, extracurricular activities, and
family and intimate relationships. High school is also the period in which most 
young adults are exposed to alcohol for the first time in their lives. Though alcohol 
consumption is harmful at any level, drinking can be especially detrimental to 
teenagers because they are in a vulnerable point in their lives. The below
visualizations will explore what factors influence a high school student's health 
and success (achieving good grades), taking a deeper look at how alcohol consumption, 
family and romantic relationships, health status, final grade, and other social variables 
are related to each other in the context of high school students' lives. 

These data were collected by the University of Camerino in Camerino, Italy, in 2017. 
The data were obtained through surveying secondary school (high school) students 
from two high schools in Italy. 


# Understanding Students' Drinking Habits

### Plot 1: Alcohol Consumption by Age 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
library(ggpubr)

p9a <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = drinking, color = drinking)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
  scale_color_viridis(option = "plasma") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  stat_cor(method = "pearson", r.accuracy = 0.01, p.accuracy = 0.001, label.x.npc = 0.8) + 
  # facet_grid(.~sex, labeller = as_labeller(c("F" = "Female", "M" = "Male"))) + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Alcohol Consumption", 
       x = "Age", y = "Alcohol Consumption Level") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:5, labels = c("Very low", "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Very high")) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        strip.text = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  guides(color = FALSE)

p9a
```

In Plot 1, age and alcohol consumption level appear to have a positive relationship 
with a Pearson correlation coefficient value equal to 0.12. As age increases, the amount 
of alcohol high school students are drinking increases. This trend is visible as 
the density of points around very low and low alcohol consumption levels decrease 
the density of points around moderate and high levels increases as age increases.


### Plot 2: Alcohol Consumption by Age and Sex

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
library(ggpubr)

p9 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = age, y = drinking, color = drinking)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
  scale_color_viridis(option = "plasma") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  stat_cor(method = "pearson", r.accuracy = 0.01, p.accuracy = 0.001, label.x.npc = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(.~sex, labeller = as_labeller(c("F" = "Female", "M" = "Male"))) + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Alcohol Consumption", 
       x = "Age", y = "Alcohol Consumption Level") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:5, labels = c("Very low", "Low", "Moderate", "High", "Very high")) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        strip.text = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust = 0.5)) + 
  guides(color = FALSE)

p9
```

However, there appears to be a stark difference in female versus male drinking 
habits. While the amount of alcohol females drink barely increases with age, 
the amount of alcohol males drink increases much more noticeably. The correlation 
coefficients for each of the graphs also reflect this, with $R=0.01$ for females 
and $R=0.25$ for males. Also looking at Plot 2, most females are clustered around 
the very low to moderate alcohol consumption levels, while males are evenly 
distributed across all levels. 


### Plot 3: Drinking Habits and Physical Health

Link to Shiny App:  
<https://kelscam.shinyapps.io/Project_BestPlot/> 

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("BestPlota.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("BestPlotb.png")
```

Plot 3 visualizes the relationship between alcohol consumption and health status. 
The Shiny App includes the option to view the data all together or by sex. Looking at
the data together, the highest number of students who reported very good health 
reported low or very low alcohol consumption. When the data is grouped by sex, 
the effect of alcohol consumption on health slightly changes. There is a higher 
number of girls than boys who report very poor to moderate health as alcohol 
consumption increases. The density or number of students is indicated by the 
saturation of the heat map grid. Grouping by sex, the detrimental effects of drinking 
on females compared to the relatively harmless effect on males is apparent, as 
a larger number of males (indicated by the darker hue) still report moderate 
health status despite moderate to high alcohol consumption. On the other hand, 
there is a steep drop off in the health status of females even just between those
who drink very low and low levels of alcohol. This plot relates to Plot 2, as it 
shows that even though males drink more with age, they suffer less severe health 
consequences from drinking than females do. 


# Factors that Influence Students' Academic Success

### Plot 4: Drinking Habits and Final Grades

Link to Shiny App:
<https://kelscam.shinyapps.io/ProjectApp1/>

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("App1a.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("App1b.png")
```

Plot 4 visualizes the relationship between students' weekday and weekend alcohol 
consumption on final grade. The dropdown menu allows the user to switch between 
weekday and weekend alcohol consumption. Looking at the ridge plot for weekday 
alcohol consumption and final grades, the highest distribution of students 
earning 80-100s are ones with very low drinking during the week. \newline
Looking at the plot for weekend alcohol consumption, the ridges of students who 
drink very low to moderate amounts of alcohol all have a high distribution of 
students earning high final grades. Drinking on the weekend versus the weekday is 
less detrimental to a student's final grade. This makes intuitive sense because the 
week is much more academically demanding with classes, assignments, and exams.


### Plot 5: Absences, Study Time, and Final Grade

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(plotly)

study.df <- df %>%
  mutate(studytime = case_when(
    studytime == 1 ~ "<2 hours",
    studytime == 2 ~ "2-5 hours",
    studytime == 3 ~ "5-10 hours",
    studytime == 4 ~ ">10 hours",
    TRUE ~ as.character(studytime)
  ))

study.df$studytime <- factor(study.df$studytime, labels = c("<2 hours", "2-5 hours", "5-10 hours", ">10 hours"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
p2colors <- viridisLite::viridis(4, option = "plasma")

p2 <- plot_ly(study.df, x = ~absences, y = ~final.grade, color = ~studytime, colors = p2colors,
               text = ~paste(studytime, "spent studying per week"), 
               hoverinfo = "text", type="scatter", mode="markers", marker = list(opacity = 0.7, size=8)) %>% 
  layout(title = list(text = "Total Absences vs. Final Grade", size = 20), 
         xaxis = list(title = "Absences", titlefont = list(size = 16), tickfont = list(size = 14)),
         yaxis = list(title = "Final Grade", titlefont = list(size = 16), tickfont = list(size = 14)),
         showlegend = TRUE, 
         legend = list(title = list(text = "Study Time per Week"))) 

p2
```

Plot 5 visualizes students' total absences, their final grades, and the hours 
they spent studying per week. The clustering of the point reveals a general trend 
between total absences and final grade; students with less absences earned higher grades. 
The majority of students with high grades and low absences spent over 5 hours 
studying per week, compared to students with higher absences and lower grades who 
spent less than 5 hours studying. However, absences appears to have a stronger 
association with students' final grades than study time, as the students with 
varying study times are scattered throughout the plot. This pattern is especially 
evident in students who spent between 5 and 10 hours studying per week. Some had 
low absences and high grades, others had high absences and low grades, and others 
fell into neither of these categories. There are also a few students who spent 
less than 2 hours studying per week, but they rarely were absent and achieved high 
final grades. Overall, there is a stronger association between low absences and 
higher final grades than hours spent studying per week.   



### Plot 6: Physical Health and Final Grade

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Pre-processing 

grades_df <- df %>% select(first.period.grade, second.period.grade, final.grade, health.status)
grades_df <- gather(grades_df, period, grade, 1:3)
grades_df$Period <- grades_df$period
grades_df$Period <- factor(grades_df$Period, levels = c("first.period.grade", "second.period.grade", "final.grade"))

grades_df <- grades_df %>%
  mutate(Period = case_when(
    Period == "first.period.grade" ~ "1st Semester",
    Period == "second.period.grade" ~ "2nd Semester",
    Period == "final.grade" ~ "Final",
    TRUE ~ as.character(Period)
  ))

grades_df <- grades_df %>%
  mutate(health.status = case_when(
    health.status == 1 ~ "Very Good",
    health.status == 2 ~ "Good",
    health.status == 3 ~ "Moderate",
    health.status == 4 ~ "Poor",
    health.status == 5 ~ "Very Poor",
    TRUE ~ as.character(health.status)
  ))

grades_df$health.status <- factor(grades_df$health.status, levels = c("Very Good", "Good", "Moderate", "Poor", "Very Poor"))
```

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
p5colors <- c("blue4", "grey", "grey", "grey", "grey")

p5 <- plot_ly(grades_df, x = ~factor(health.status), y = ~grade, type = "violin", frame = ~Period,
             color = ~factor(health.status), colors = p5colors) %>% 
  layout(
    title = list(text = "Grade Distribution by Student's Health Condition over Semester", size = 20),
            xaxis = list(title = "Health Status", titlefont = list(size = 16), tickfont = list(size = 14)),
            yaxis = list(title = "Grade", range = c(0, 100), titlefont = list(size = 16), tickfont = list(size = 14), dtick = 10),
            boxmode = "group", 
            showlegend = FALSE) %>%
  animation_opts(frame = 1000,  # Controls speed of transition; higher number = slower
                 redraw = TRUE, # Redraws the plot in each frame
                 easing = "linear") %>% # FIX THIS PART
  
  layout(
   updatemenus = list( 
     list(
       type = "buttons", 
       showactive = FALSE,
       x = 0, 
       y = -0.05, 
       buttons = list(
         
        list(
           label = "Pause", # Name of the label
           method = "animate", # What do to when the button is clicked
           args = list(NULL, list(frame = list(duration = 0,  # Stops immediately
                                               redraw = TRUE), 
                                  mode = "immediate"))
         )
       )
     )
   )
 ) 
    

p5
```

Plot 6 visualizes the distribution of students' first semester, second semester, and final grades throughout the year by their health status. In the first semester, students reporting very good health earned an average grade in all their classes 5 points higher than students who reported good to very poor health. By the second semester, this trend becomes more apparent, with students reporting very good health earning a median grade 10 points higher than other students. This difference was also reflected in students' final grades. Health status seems to be an important factor in students achieving better grades, as there is a strong positive association between better health and higher grades. 

### Plot 7: Free Time, Extracurricular Activites, and Final Grade 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
p7 <- ggplot(df, aes(x=factor(freetime), y=final.grade)) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill=factor(freetime))) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  facet_grid(.~activities, labeller = as_labeller(c("0" = "No Extracurriculars", "1" = "Extracurriculars"))) + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) + 
  labs(title = "Final Grade Distribution by How Freetime is Spent", x = "Amount of Freetime after School", y = "Final Grade") + 
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:5, labels = c("A lot less", "Less", "Some", "More", "A lot more")) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        strip.text = element_text(size = 14), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10))


p7
```

Plot 7 visualizes how students are spending their free time after school, and if 
students with more free time are earning better grades. For students not involved 
in extracurricular activities after school, the grade distributions for students 
with less free time was higher compared to those of students with more free time. 
Students with less free time achieved the highest median grade compared to 
students with a lot less, some, more, and a lot less free time. \newline 
Students who participate in extracurriculars reveal similar trends. Comparing 
the overall distributions between students who do extracurriculars versus those 
who don't, students who do extracurriculars achieved higher median and third 
percentile grades except for students with a lot less free time. Generally, 
students who participate in extracurriculars achieved higher final grades.



# Effect of Family and Upbringing on Student Outcomes  

### Plot 8: Higher Education and Parents' Education Levels

Link to Shiny App:  
<https://kelscam.shinyapps.io/ProjectApp2/>

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("App2a.png")
```

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("App2b.png")
```

Plot 8 visualizes students interest in attending college by their mother's and 
father's highest education levels. Looking at the graph of mother's highest 
education level, the number of students who want to go to college relative to 
those who don't is highest for students with mothers who attained university or
higher degrees. The trend is the same for father's highest education level, with 
both graphs showing a decrease in the relative number of student's who want 
to go to college as parent's highest level of education becomes more basic, ranging from 
high school to no education at all. Though not a perfect indicator, parents' highest
education levels serve as a socioeconomic variable for students because it provides context for what kind of advantages or disadvantages they faced growing up (e.g. whether they will be a first-generation college student). Students are more likely to pursue a college education if their parents did. Perhaps, this may motivate them to earn higher grades, take on more extracurricular activities, and drink less.  


### Plot 9: Family and Romantic Relationships

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggalluvial)

alluv_df <- df %>% 
  group_by(romantic, famrel, health.status) %>% 
  summarize(freq = n())

alluv_df$romantic <- factor(alluv_df$romantic, labels = c("No", "Yes"))
alluv_df$famrel <- factor(alluv_df$famrel, labels = c("Very poor", "Poor", "Decent", "Good", "Very Good"))
```


```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.align = 'center'}
p8 <- ggplot(alluv_df, 
       aes(y = freq, axis2 = factor(romantic), axis1 = factor(famrel))) + 
         geom_alluvium(aes(fill = factor(famrel)), width = 0, knot.pos = 1/4, reverse = FALSE) + 
  guides(fill = "none") +
  geom_stratum(width = 1/8, reverse = FALSE) +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), reverse = FALSE, size = 3.25) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:2, labels = c("Quality of Family Relationships", "Romantic Partner")) + 
  labs(title = "Satisfaction with Family and Romantic Relationships", y = "Frequency") + 
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "plasma") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 16, hjust = 0.5), 
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)) 

p8 
```

Plot 9 visualizes students' responses to how they rate the quality of their family relationships and whether they have a romantic partner or not. Out of the students who reported having very good 
or good relationships with their families, about 1 in 3 of them had a romantic 
partner. For students with decent relationships with their families, this dropped 
to 1 in 4 students, and for students with poor and very poor family relationships, the 
number with romantic partners was even lower. This plot doesn't make it clear 
whether good family relationships make it more likely for students to find 
romantic partners, but it does show that there is a clear link between the two. 
Relationships and connection are vital to the well-being and success of any person, so it is interesting to see if there is a link between quality of family relationships and 
having a romantic partner in high school students.
